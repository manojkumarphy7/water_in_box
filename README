Water Box Simulation

This directory contains the complete workflow for a molecular dynamics simulation of liquid water inside a periodic box. The system was created by defining a cubic box and filling it with water molecules using standard GROMACS tools. The simulation follows the usual sequence of minimization, equilibration and production, allowing the study of bulk water structure, density, energy stability and other basic properties.

initial
Contains the starting coordinate file, topology and any force field information used to build the water box. This is the system before relaxation or equilibration.

1_em
Contains the outputs from the energy minimization step. Minimization removes bad contacts and relaxes the initial water configuration. Files usually include the minimization log, energy file and minimized structure.

2_equil
Stores the equilibration data for both NVT and NPT runs. These steps stabilize the temperature and pressure and allow the box size to adjust to the correct density of liquid water. Logs, energy files, checkpoint files and equilibrated structures are found here.

3_prod
Contains the production simulation outputs. This includes the trajectory, final structure, energy files, logs and checkpoint files used for analysis of bulk water behavior.

How to Regenerate Trajectories (.xtc)

If the xtc trajectory file is not included, it can be generated by rerunning the final tpr file using GROMACS version apps/gromacs/2024.2.

For this version:

gmx mdrun -deffnm md

This will recreate md.xtc, md.trr and other standard output files.

If you are using a different GROMACS version, first generate a new tpr and then run mdrun.

gmx grompp -f mdp/md.mdp -c results/npt.gro -p input/topol.top -o md.tpr

gmx mdrun -deffnm md

How to Use

Review input/ for system setup files. Check mdp/ for parameter settings. Explore results/ for final structures, logs and regenerated trajectories. Add any new scripts to scripts/ if the workflow is extended.
